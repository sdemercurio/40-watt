        <p>Resonance. It’s what I felt in my early 20’s when I first volunteered as a basketball coach at the local high
          school. I’d tapped into something deeply meaningful to me that gave me joy, fulfillment, and even
          fearlessness. It had little to do with the sports side of coaching--it was about forming a connection with
          players and helping them improve as people.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Nearly 20 years later, it’s that same resonance I’m chasing as I launch my own coaching and professional
          training business.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I am an executive coach, corporate trainer, and consultant based in San Francisco. I specialize in helping
          leaders find their authentic voices (and “leader” has nothing to do with title). I’ve coached and trained
          C-Suite executives as well as individuals of all experience levels at several global organizations since 2014.
          Prior to this I spent 13 years in client facing roles--both in corporations and non-profit. More recently, I
          led training and development for managers at a pre-IPO fintech company based in San Francisco.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Just like I learned coaching student athletes earlier in my career, it starts with trust. Once that’s earned
          we can go further than we ever imagined.</p>

            uncanny how much people improve after just one session. Colleagues who could barely make eye contact before
            suddenly seem ready for the TED stage. I've tried a lot of media trainers and speaking coaches over the
            years, and Tim is hands-down the best. He puts in the pre-work to deeply understand the people he's training
            and their unique needs. It was a joy partnering with him to design a series of group and 1-1 sessions for
            teams on two continents.”</p>

            training sessions for us long before the pandemic made that a more common thing. He understood our team

            management challenges in our coaching sessions that I am not comfortable discussing with my peers at work,
            or even my friends. In the last few months, this has helped me prioritize what's important for me as a

            first was a cross functional team offsite L&D experience, second was in a 300+ person training, and third
            was in 1:1 coaching. In all three settings, Tim brought a combination of applicable coaching, practice,
            hands on tips, and things to try that could be used in myriad ways with customers and internal stakeholder

            like the difference between buying an off-the-rack suit and working with a fine tailor to build something
